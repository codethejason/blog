&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1:16bf5589f9e0be23236c59a1c0e40681&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My trip started out on June 12, 2016 by a morning flight to San Francisco. The Newark TSA line was actually shorter than expected! After some turbulence on the plane, I promptly arrived to San Francisco in the afternoon. My dad, mom, and I spent some time in the hotel and entered the welcome ceremony. I knew some of the people by name already since the GCI winners talked in a chat previous to the event. I met my FOSSASIA counterpart, Yathannsh Kulshreshtha, and other GCI students from other organizations. We played the Human Scavenger Game to get to know each other. Everyone was surprised to some pleasant gifts after the ceremony including a phone (Nexus 5X). After the ceremony, Yathannsh and I fixed FOSSASIA’s GCI website for Monday’s presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2:16bf5589f9e0be23236c59a1c0e40681&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Monday morning, GCI winners, parents, and mentors arrived at Google’s headquarters at Mountain View, California. We rode the coach bus around the gigantic campus (basically a small city inside Mountain View) and got off in the engineering building. As I looked around, I saw Google bikes zooming down the roads around the campus and saw a self-driving car in the lane next to us. After receiving awards and giving a short presentation on my activities I performed in FOSSASIA, we ate a full lunch. Googlers are extremely lucky to get such a wide selection of food for free! There were food from many countries including India, Japan, and Italy. In the afternoon, we listened to different captivating presentations: Google Expeditions, Self-Driving Cars, SAMBA, and Chrome OS. Afterwards, we took a bus to Google’s visitor center to look at the history of Google and shop for apparel with the credit they gave us. We were then treated to an appetizing dinner. I dozed off on the way back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-3:16bf5589f9e0be23236c59a1c0e40681&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was “fun day”. My dad and I along with others in the group had the chance to ride Segways down Fisherman’s Wharf. It was a very exhilarating experience as it was our first times riding them. I thought we were going to ride the Segways down the sidewalk, but instead we rode them on the same roads cars were driving on! During lunch, we went to Ghirardelli’s square for chocolate and ate at a pub. After being completely satisfied (and not finishing my lunch for the first time in ages), we walked the Golden Gate Bridge (3.4 miles roundtrip) in about an hour and fifteen minutes. We ended the day by taking a cruise on a private yacht and were served to a delightful steak and chicken dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-4:16bf5589f9e0be23236c59a1c0e40681&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wednesday was the day of the official Google Code-in trip. Today, the last Googlers spoke about Tensorflow (machine learning), Google Cloud Platform, Google Fi, and Science Journal in the San Francisco office. The San Francisco office was much more plain than Googleplex; on the outside, one could not even tell that part of the building is a Google office. I don&amp;rsquo;t feel too well today because I ate too many potato chips at the pub yesterday. I had a chance to meet Jen the Magnet alumni and talked to her about her career progression after Magnet and Columbia. The most painful part has now arrived: departing from the mentors and other GCI students. I said my goodbyes to my mentor Hong Phuc Dang, Stephanie, and other students. This was one of my favorite trips I have ever been on and will miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just a short post to acknowledge that I have won one of 28 spots in the Google Code-in contest (more details &lt;a href=&#34;http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2016/02/announcing-google-code-in-2015-winners.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I am extremely excited for the trip to Google Headquarters. I will attempt to continue contributing to FOSSASIA, but it is difficult due to time restraints with school and other activities. Once again, I thank all the people involved with helping me to build my knowledge and ultimately win the grand prize.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Google Code-in Experience with FOSSASIA</title>

&lt;p&gt;As we all know, Google Code-in 2015 is sadly coming to a close on January 25, 2016. In this blog post, I will describe my wonderful experience working with the awesome FOSSASIA community while learning tons of new stuff. I would like to thank the admins &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mariobehling&#34;&gt;Mario Behling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hpdang&#34;&gt;Hong Phuc Dang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mohitkanwal&#34;&gt;Mohit Kanwal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for making this FOSSASIA&amp;rsquo;s participation in GCI possible. I would also like to thank all the mentors for guidance and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/fossasia.png&#34; alt=&#34;fossasia&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;coming-into-gci:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873&#34;&gt;Coming into GCI&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I entered the contest right from the beginning: December 7, 2015. FOSSASIA instantly jumped out at m while browsing the list of organizations. I liked the mission of spreading free and open source software to form a better future with Open Technologies and ICT and promoting growth in science in youth. I decided to dedicate my time with FOSSASIA for the entire length of Google Code-in. I was so excited to learn new technologies and put my programming skills that I have learned before into use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/computer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;computers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;projects:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/codethejason/gci2015&#34;&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; varied widely ranging from hangman in JavaScript to a user management system in PHP Codeignitor.  I tried to claim a variety of tasks but ended up mainly focusing on Javascript tasks. I had a chance to learn NodeJS and apply it to a GitHub OAuth application. My favorite application was my &lt;a href=&#34;http://codethejason.github.io/checkers/&#34;&gt;checkers&lt;/a&gt; app. It is completely based on objects including the board, pieces, and tiles. This object oriented design I learned by reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Don&amp;rsquo;t Know JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to understand the code and improve it. A few other people used this through GNU Licensing to accomplish their tasks (i.e. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yasoob/checkers&#34;&gt;yasoob&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shiftsayan/checkers&#34;&gt;shiftsayan&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pharo tasks created by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eMBee&#34;&gt;eMBee (Martin)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; were especially interesting because I learned a computer language I had never seen or heard of before in my life. The language was completely different than what I was used to seeing (for example, operators in Pharo are actually binary messages); it is probably one of the most difficult languages I have learned (also difficult to find quick answers because of the small community). It took some time for me to get used to it, but I ended up making a light-sout game, a user management application, a web application (which was very  different from a web application I would build on PHP, NodeJS, or Python), and a REST API. You can see my packages &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~codethejason&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/repos.png&#34; alt=&#34;prwatch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;contributions:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873&#34;&gt;Contributions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made many contributions during the course of GCI to Loklak-Webtweets, WhatcanIdoforFOSSASIA, and more. I built a GitHub PR Autoresponder bot to comment the preview link each time someone opened a pull request on the FOSSASIA GCI student site. I will keep improving it in the future, and one of the improvements will be porting it to NodeJS. A sample post made by &lt;code&gt;prwatch&lt;/code&gt; is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/prwatch.png&#34; alt=&#34;prwatch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not know anything about the GitHub API or webhooks before this task; I did not know GitHub offered so many management tools to take control of the project. Though my previous knowledge of GitHub was a huge help to me, there were no merge conflicts or other issues to deal with. This experience gave me the taste of what open source collaboration is like with Git (and also the annoyances of merge conflicts). I got a chance to put the objectives I learned in school into use in real world applications and to extend my knowledge of Git further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also contributed to the &lt;a href=&#34;github.com/fossasia/gci15.fossasia.org&#34;&gt;GCI Student Site&lt;/a&gt; by replacing the twitter widget with a loklak implementation, improving the blog section dramatically, adding the loklak peers and footer section, and doing a lot of other contributions to improve the overall user experience. Special thanks to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mariobehling&#34;&gt;Mario Behling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jig08&#34;&gt;Jigyasa Grover&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roonyh&#34;&gt;Aruna Herath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sudheesh001&#34;&gt;Sudheesh Singanamalla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mananwason&#34;&gt;Manan Wason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nikunjness&#34;&gt;Nikunj Thakkar&lt;/a&gt; for working with me on the GCI site and other side projects. I implemented Loklak&amp;rsquo;s search API on the 2015 and 2016 FOSSASIA event sites as well as on &lt;a href=&#34;http://fossasia.org&#34;&gt;fossasia.org&lt;/a&gt;. I helped others with issues on GitHub and also invited a few of my friends to join GCI with FOSSASIA (i.e. aristochaotic, scorpianz1525). I was also involved with contributing to loklak_webclient, showing tutorials on how to setup Loklak, and implementing it on all of the FOSSASIA event sites and the FOSSASIA GCI student site with the mentors listed above and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/orbiter&#34;&gt;Orbiter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/pr.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;prwatch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;gci-improvements-for-next-year:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873&#34;&gt;GCI Improvements for Next Year&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOSSASIA did an awesome job as an organization for GCI. All the mentors were helpful and guided me towards my goals. In the beginning, it took a while for me to be added to the FOSSASIA GCI Students group, but the application that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roonyh&#34;&gt;roonyh (Aruna Herath)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; built will allow all mentors to add students to the group (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/roonyh/fossasia-gci-companion&#34;&gt;FOSSASIA GCI Companion&lt;/a&gt;), speeding up the process next year. I also thought the task instances could be better managed as in some cases the task was still open while it was already accomplished. More specialized varied &amp;lsquo;learning&amp;rsquo;  tasks could be added (i.e. learning electron with NodeJS), but the variety of tasks this year was pretty decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;future-for-myself:b044e5a8ff8584fdadee498d91837873&#34;&gt;Future for Myself&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned more from this contest than I have in any classroom environment. I learned new programming practices, used services to make development more efficient, fiddled with new languages, and had a chance to utilize the concepts I learned previously. The most important thing I learned about by far is open source. Open source allows everyone to benefit from the freely available source code. It also allows the software to be more secure, flexible, and &amp;ldquo;featureful&amp;rdquo;, increasing the quality of the software. Let us take a look at my commit history:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../gci/contributions.png&#34; alt=&#34;contributions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never been engaged in any open source project before, but after GCI I will now continue to stick with FOSSASIA and explore other projects that interest me. Knowing I can gain experience and help the world at the same time is a wonderful feeling. Anyways, I hope fellow students also enjoyed their time at GCI and will continue to contribute to open source! Good luck to all!&lt;/p&gt;
