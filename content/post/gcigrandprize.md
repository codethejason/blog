This is just a short post to acknowledge that I have won one of 28 spots in the Google Code-in contest (more details [here](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2016/02/announcing-google-code-in-2015-winners.html)). I am extremely excited for the trip to Google Headquarters. I will attempt to continue contributing to FOSSASIA, but it is difficult due to time restraints with school and other activities. Once again, I thank all the people involved with helping me to build my knowledge and ultimately win the grand prize.
